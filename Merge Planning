Approach for cart merging on Stack Store

schema.methods.merge = function ( anonCart ) {
	
	this.products = this.products.concat(anonCart.products);
	anonCart.remove();

}


How can we identify both the anonymous cart and the user's cart in the DB?

				anonCart			userCart
	session: 	session.ID 			n/a
	userId: 	n/a					user by Reference
	products:   3					4


Plan of attack:
	On the backend...
		0. There are two carts in the DB: One has a session ID, As a returning shopper, you also have a cart model document with user by reference...
		1. we need to find the two carts, one via sessionID, and the other via actual user's Reference
		2. We need to run .merge on both carts
		3. We need to destroy the anonymous cart

On the front-end...

		0. If you are anonymous, display the anonymous cart, i.e. by Session ID
		1. If you are logged in, displaly the user's cart 


IF User has logged in...

	Check if user has both an anonymous cart and a user cart {
		Merge carts
	}

	else {

		Work with User Cart

	}
