	models: consider some more validations

	tax seems awkward to be stored in the cart model

	rename getPrice to fix price

	Change subtotal to a virtual instead of storing.

	ON the product model, you might want to add a method that checks a product against a whitelist.

		expires may be a mongoose keyword. (createdAt)

		Mongo will delete a document based on that keyword/time comparison.

	On the order Model, may need a method for applying the promotions and calculations afterwards...

	Store methods:

		isOpen?
		storeLocation?
		distance?

	User method:

		hasRole:

	Model saving
		.findByIdAndUpdate will not hit the pre/post save hooks
